At the beginning of the summer (2017), I started logging what I do each day in terms of programming and computer science. I was using a Google Doc before, but it was getting a bit large. So, I decided to create a small little web app that lists tasks I work on each day. You can visit the page here, [link](http://davidzhao.me/Current/).

## How it works
This web app just uses the basic languages: Html, JS, CSS. The content is stored on Firebase as GitHub pages is not made to support a backend like SQL or Java. The javascript setup is AMD style with RequireJS, UnderscoreJS, and JQuery.
